  <h1>What is Up-Screening?</h1>
  <br>
  <p>
    Up-Screening is the process of screening and characterizing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) electronic components to high-reliability levels tailored to customer needs.
    Through evaluations that reflect real operating environments—high/low temperature, vibration, electrical stress, and radiation—the performance and stability of components can be verified in advance.
    This allows reliable use of cost-effective industrial-grade parts instead of expensive military or space-grade components,
    achieving both cost savings and shorter lead times.

          <div class="text-section">
            Single Event Effects (SEE) arise when radiation (protons, neutrons, heavy ions, gamma rays, etc.) ionizes matter while passing through a semiconductor, inducing functional errors in circuits.
            If the electron–hole pairs generated by ionization reach sensitive regions in sufficient quantity to change operating states, errors occur.
            Most SEEs are non-destructive and transient; normal operation resumes after resetting values or power.
