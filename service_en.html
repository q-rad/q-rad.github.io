  <h1>What Is Up-Screening?</h1>
  <br>
  <p>
    Up-Screening is the process of selecting and characterizing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components to a
    high-reliability level that meets your mission needs. Through evaluations representative of real use-high/low
    temperature, vibration, electrical stress, and radiation-we verify performance and stability in advance.
    This enables you to confidently deploy cost-effective industrial-grade parts instead of expensive military/space parts,
    reducing cost and lead time without compromising reliability.

            Life Test operates devices at elevated temperature for 2000+ hours to ensure long-term functionality and
            performance stability. It is essential for lifetime prediction and is accompanied by MIL-standard electrical
            characterization.<br>
            Burn-in applies thermal and electrical stress to precipitate and remove infant-mortality failures. Typical
            conditions are 125&nbsp;°C/240&nbsp;h, 105&nbsp;°C/445&nbsp;h, or 85&nbsp;°C/885&nbsp;h in accordance with MIL-STD-750/883.
            Test temperature and number of device samples must be considered with device specifications.
            Anti-oxidation handling is also required after the burn-in process.

            TID is the total energy absorbed when a device is exposed to radiation (gamma, X-ray, electron, etc.) over
            time. Accumulation can gradually shift parameters or impair function. QRT performs TID testing using
            domestic (Korean) gamma-ray facilities.

          <div class="text-section">
            Displacement Damage (DD) occurs in the bulk of a semiconductor, unlike Total Ionizing Dose (TID), 
            which is confined to the interface. This damage, which affects the entire bulk, can alter the electrical, 
            optical, and thermal properties of the semiconductor, leading to degraded device performance or even 
            functional failure. QRT performs Displacement Damage testing using domestic (Korean) proton facilities.

        <div class="content-row">
          <div class="text-section">
            Pulsed-laser SEE testing (PLSEE) uses a femtosecond pulsed laser to emulate how space radiation affects
            semiconductor devices, providing a rapid, high-resolution alternative/complement to conventional beam tests.
            With years of hands-on experience, QRT supports both SPA (single-photon absorption) and TPA (two-photon
            absorption) modes. With Pulsed-laser, SEE analysis and design verification are available at QRT.

        <div class="content-row">
          <div class="text-section">
            SEEs occur when radiation (protons, neutrons, heavy ions, gamma, etc.) ionizes the medium as it passes
            through a device. If the generated charge reaches a sensitive region with sufficient magnitude to change
            state, an error occurs. Most SEEs are non-destructive and temporary; normal operation resumes after a
            reset or power cycle.
