# TID (Total Ionizing Dose) effect

Charges generated by radiation can accumulate within a semiconductor and gradually alter its properties. This is quantified by the Total Ionizing Dose (TID).  
In CMOS devices, the ionizing dose can lead to charge trapping in the insulating layer or induce defects in the crystal structure.

As the gate oxide becomes thinner, radiation effects on the gate stack are significantly reduced (due to the smaller oxide volume available for charge trapping).  
However, damage and ion trapping can still occur in the thicker isolation oxide that surrounds the conductive channel.

Generally, TID effects caused by neutrons in neutron accelerator tests or at high altitudes are negligible.  
However, ultra-cold neutrons and thermal neutrons are known to gradually degrade semiconductor characteristics through TID-related mechanisms.

For radiation particles, multiplying the LET (Linear Energy Transfer) of the particle by the particle fluence (dose) of a monoenergetic beam yields the total energy deposited per unit mass due to ionization — this value is used to determine TID.
