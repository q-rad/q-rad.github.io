# Semiconductor Radiation Hardness Laser Evaluation (Laser Test)
Pulsed Laser SEE Test (PLSEE) is a method of evaluating semiconductor radiation hardness using femtosecond pulsed lasers. It simulates the effects of space radiation on semiconductor devices using pulsed lasers, offering an alternative to traditional radiation testing.

Lasers can deliver extremely high energy to a localized area in a very short time, inducing electromagnetic responses comparable to actual particle collisions.  
SEE evaluations are typically conducted at [heavy ion beam](/en/article/10.중이온.html) accelerator facilities.  
However, these facilities have drawbacks such as high rental costs, spatial limitations, and the inability to perform precise vulnerability analyses.  

The greatest advantage of laser testing is the reduction in experiment cost and time.  
Traditional radiation tests using particle accelerators are expensive and limited in availability, making it difficult to secure testing opportunities.  
In contrast, laser-based equipment is relatively inexpensive, can be installed and operated in a laboratory setting, and allows for rapid iterative testing.  

Additionally, lasers provide extremely high positional accuracy, enabling precise targeting of specific areas within semiconductor devices and facilitating analysis of weak spots.  
This makes it possible to identify and mitigate radiation vulnerabilities from the early stages of design.

## QRT's Laser Evaluation Technology
QRT is the only domestic company with many years of experience in performing laser-based radiation evaluation.  
Using a femtosecond pulsed laser system, QRT possesses multipurpose laser evaluation technology capable of implementing both Single Photon Absorption (SPA) and Two Photon Absorption (TPA) methods.  
QRT provides services for radiation hardness alternative evaluations of semiconductors using lasers, as well as radiation-tolerant semiconductor design validation.

## Sensitive Area Analysis
QRT's evaluation equipment features a high-precision XYZ stage controllable at the nanometer level, allowing precise laser targeting of specific coordinates on a chip.  
This enables detailed analysis of the locations and patterns of SEE (Single Event Effects), effectively identifying **Sensitive Areas** within the circuit.
