# Why Laser Evaluation is Necessary – A Cost Perspective

When deploying Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components in space systems, up-screening procedures are essential to ensure their reliability.  
These include mechanical, electrical, and environmental tests—and most critically, radiation hardness evaluations.
<br>
Among all up-screening steps, the Single Event Effect (SEE) test—particularly when using heavy ion beams—accounts for a disproportionately large portion of the total cost.

As shown in the chart, heavy ion-based SEE testing dominates the cost structure, far exceeding that of other evaluation categories such as TID (Total Ionizing Dose), DPA (Destructive Physical Analysis), and CA (Construction Analysis).  
While COTS components offer a lower initial purchase price compared to space-grade parts, the cost of heavy ion SEE testing during up-screening can often match—or even exceed—the cost of using certified space-grade components.

</p>

This graph illustrates the stark contrast: SEE testing with heavy ions incurs substantial costs even for a single evaluation.  
In comparison, laser-based testing of the same component is approximately four times more cost-effective.  
This undermines the expected cost savings of COTS usage, making the overall approach less efficient in some scenarios.
<br>
To address this issue, many experts advocate for replacing heavy ion tests with laser-based SEE evaluations.  
Given that radiation hardness testing—especially SEE evaluation—is one of the most expensive components of the up-screening process, laser testing presents a compelling alternative that preserves reliability while drastically reducing cost.
