# Why Laser Evaluation is Necessary - A Cost Perspective

When deploying commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components in space systems, up-screening is essential to ensure reliability.
These activities include mechanical, electrical, and environmental tests-and, critically, radiation-hardness evaluations.
<br>
Among all up-screening steps, the single-event effect (SEE) test-particularly when using heavy-ion beams-accounts for a disproportionately large share of total cost.

</p>

As shown in the chart, heavy-ion-based SEE testing dominates the cost structure, exceeding other evaluation categories such as TID (total ionizing dose), DPA (destructive physical analysis), and CA (construction analysis).
While COTS components carry a lower purchase price than space-grade parts, the cost of heavy-ion SEE testing during up-screening can match-or even exceed-the cost of using qualified space-grade components.

</p>

This comparison illustrates the contrast: heavy-ion SEE testing incurs substantial expense even for a single run.
By contrast, laser-based testing of the same device is typically about four times less expensive.
This can erode the expected cost savings from using COTS, reducing overall program efficiency in some cases.
<br>
To address this, many teams supplement-or, where appropriate, replace-heavy-ion tests with laser-based SEE evaluations.
Because radiation-effects testing-especially SEE-is often the cost driver in up-screening, laser testing offers a compelling way to preserve test coverage while significantly reducing cost.
