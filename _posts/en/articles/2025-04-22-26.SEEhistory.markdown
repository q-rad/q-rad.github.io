**Single Event Effects (SEE)** refer to temporary or permanent anomalies that occur when radiation such as cosmic rays, alpha particles, or high-energy ions strike semiconductor devices. SEE can range from soft errors such as Single Event Upsets (SEU) to destructive failures. The concept has gradually formed since the mid-20th century. This article outlines the development of SEE, particularly SEU, with a focus on historically verified data and scientific analysis.

### 1950s: First Reports of Anomalies
The origin of the SEE concept dates back to U.S. atmospheric nuclear testing in the 1950s. During high-yield tests such as Operation Castle (1954–1957), a large number of anomalies were observed in electronic equipment not directly involved in the explosions. These were suspected to be caused by radiation, although there were no analytical frameworks or tools at the time.<br>
These early observations later became crucial background for the development of the SEE concept. In particular, the frequent soft errors experienced by high-speed instrumentation during those tests are now interpreted as early signs of SEU.

### 1960s: Rising Errors in Spaceborne Electronics
During the 1960s, with the rise of space exploration, satellites and spacecraft frequently experienced unexplained anomalies in electronic systems. Agencies like NASA and Hughes attempted to determine whether these were due to design flaws or external radiation, but failed to reach clear conclusions.<br>
These reports, once the SEU concept emerged, were later explained scientifically and laid the groundwork for experimental validation in subsequent decades.

### 1972: Hughes Satellite Communication Outage
The first major academic attention toward SEE came in 1972 during a communication outage involving a Hughes satellite. The satellite lost contact with ground control for exactly 96 seconds before automatically recovering. Dr. Edward C. Smith, Al Holman, and Dr. Dan Binder analyzed the event and concluded that it was likely caused by a high-energy particle, thereby coining the term SEU.<br>
The severity of this incident—representing a full system halt—drew significant attention to the risks posed by cosmic radiation.

### 1975: First Scientific SEU Paper and Measured Data
In 1975, the aforementioned team published their findings:
>Binder, D.; Smith, E. C.; Holman, A. B. (1975). "Satellite Anomalies from Galactic Cosmic Rays", IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science, NS‑22(6): 2675–2680.

This is considered the first scientific paper to describe SEE, particularly SEU. The authors presented the following values:

- Predicted SEU rate: 3.1 × 10⁻³ SEU/transistor/year  
- Measured SEU rate: 1.5 × 10⁻³ SEU/transistor/year  

The two rates differed by less than a factor of two, demonstrating the first quantitative model for SEU occurrence in silicon-based transistor circuits.

### 1976: First Ground-Level SEU Observation on Cray‑1
SEE is not limited to space. In 1976, the Cray‑1 supercomputer operated at Los Alamos National Laboratory recorded the first ground-level SEU. Over 25 weeks, 152 parity errors were logged in a 4Kbit SRAM module.<br>
This marked the first experimental proof that SEUs can occur at sea level due to atmospheric neutrons generated by cosmic ray spallation, expanding the scope of SEE research.

### 1978: Alpha Particle-Induced SEUs from Packaging
In 1978, T.C. May and M.H. Woods were the first to prove that SEUs could originate from radioactive contamination in chip packaging. Their research concluded that a substantial number of soft errors in high-speed memories were caused by alpha particles emitted from trace amounts of uranium and thorium in the packaging materials. Moreover, the observed error rate correlated strongly with alpha particle flux.<br>
This study was the first to highlight the influence of semiconductor material and packaging on SEU vulnerability, beyond external radiation shielding.

### 1979: SEU Modeling and Heavy Ion Testing
In 1979, James F. Ziegler and W. A. Lanford developed a theoretical model showing that cosmic rays could induce memory errors even at sea level. That same year, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory conducted the world's first SEE experiment using heavy ions accelerated by the 88‑Inch Cyclotron.<br>
Later, in an IBM Journal publication (1996), Ziegler reported the average cosmic-ray–induced neutron flux to be approximately 13.5 n/cm²/s at sea level in New York.
