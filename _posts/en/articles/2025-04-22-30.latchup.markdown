# Single Event Latch-Up (SEL)

Latch‚Äëup is a phenomenon in which a low‚Äëimpedance path suddenly forms between power and ground and persists even after the triggering event disappears. SEL differs in that its trigger is ion‚Äëinduced charge. Because the initial conditions of SEL are much harsher than those of an external voltage transient, even devices that are robust against general latch‚Äëup require separate verification for SEL.
Single Event Latch‚Äëup (SEL) is a phenomenon in which high‚Äëenergy particles (primarily heavy ions) generate excess charge inside a device within a very short time (picoseconds, ps) and turn on a parasitic PNPN structure (parasitic thyristor) through a regenerative feedback mechanism. Once triggered, a low‚Äëimpedance, high‚Äëcurrent state persists until power is removed, which can cause anything from loss of functionality to destructive damage.

# Turn-on sequence of the parasitic PNPN structure induced by heavy ions

**‚ë†** When a heavy ion or other high-energy particle penetrates the n-well, a large number of electron‚Äìhole pairs are instantaneously generated along the collision path (picoseconds‚Äìnanoseconds).
Immediately after generation, charges are collected by drift due to the electric field at the junction surface; electrons move mainly toward the n-well, and holes move mainly toward the p-substrate. This injected current causes a voltage drop (Œîùëâ=ùêº‚ãÖùëÖ) across the n-well resistance R<sub>Nwell</sub> and the p-substrate resistance R<sub>Psub</sub>. <br>
**‚ë°** While the majority carriers of the n-well, electrons, are collected at the n-well tap (n+ well contact connected to VDD), the voltage drop across R<sub>Nwell</sub> lowers the local n-well (base) potential relative to VDD. If this potential difference becomes large enough to forward-bias the junction between P<sup>+</sup> and the n-well (E-B of the parasitic vertical PNP), the PNP turns on first and injects holes from P<sup>+</sup> (emitter) to the p-substrate (collector). (The P<sup>+</sup> source/drain of the PMOS serves as the emitter of this PNP.) <br>
**‚ë¢** The hole current flowing into the p-substrate (base) exits through the p<sup>+</sup> substrate tap (connected to VSS), creating an additional voltage drop due to R<sub>Psub</sub>. At this time, if the p-substrate (base) potential rises above the local n<sup>+</sup> (emitter, near VSS), the E-B of the parasitic lateral NPN is forward-biased and the NPN turns on, <br>
**‚ë£** Electrons are injected from the n+ emitter into the p-substrate (base) and collected into the n-well (collector) (the observed current flows in the direction from the collector (n-well) to the emitter (n+)). This increases the n-well current and the voltage drop across R<sub>Nwell</sub>, which in turn further strengthens the forward bias of the PNP, forming a feedback structure. <br>

> The device that turns on first can be PNP or, depending on conditions, NPN (depending on the ion‚Äôs LET/trajectory, strike location, tap density, etc.). In either case, the parasitic PNPN structure is activated.

# Factors affecting the turn-on of the parasitic PNPN structure

<ul class="qrt-list">

<li>Particle physics (primary factor): The ion species, LET (linear energy transfer), and trajectory determine the amount and spatial distribution of charge generated in the sensitive region. The higher the LET, the more charge is injected and the higher the probability of SEL occurrence. Larger induced current leads to larger induced voltage, increasing the likelihood of forming an E-B forward bias.</li>

<li>Doping/resistance: The lower the substrate/well doping, the higher the sheet resistance, so the same charge creates a larger ŒîV, lowering the turn-on threshold charge.</li>

<li>Guard ring/tap spacing: The farther the generation point of electron‚Äìhole pairs is from the nearest tap, the larger the path resistance becomes, making the parasitic BJTs turn on more easily.</li>

<li>Operating voltage: The higher the V<sub>DD</sub>, the larger the voltage across each resistance, making SEL possible with less charge.</li>

<li>Temperature: Temperature rise generally reduces BJT turn-on voltage and increases Œ≤ (bipolar gain), accelerating turn-on and increasing the gain product, thereby raising the likelihood of SEL.</li>
</ul>

SEL is a fatal error that does not recover until power is cut off. Even if it does not appear externally, potential damage such as metal melting, microcracks, and electromigration can occur, leading to reduced lifetime. In severe cases, the device can be destroyed by thermal runaway due to large current.
Therefore, SEL evaluation is essential for devices operated in environments exposed to radiation such as space, aviation, accelerators, and high altitude. In addition, general latch-up robustness cannot guarantee SEL robustness, so heavy-ion evaluation is required.
