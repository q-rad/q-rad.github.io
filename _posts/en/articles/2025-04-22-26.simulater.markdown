# [TCAD](https://www.synopsys.com/manufacturing/tcad.html) - Synopsys

Synopsys TCAD is a commercial software suite widely used for simulating semiconductor device behavior and fabrication processes. It provides physical-based models to simulate radiation effects such as electron-hole pair generation, charge transport, and trap creation under high-energy ion impact. It is particularly effective for evaluating SEU/SET based on LET and for assessing TID effects.
Through transient simulation, TCAD accurately models time-dependent current density, voltage anomalies, and transistor parameter shifts. It is often used to quantitatively predict radiation effects prior to experimental SEE testing.

# [FLUKA](https://fluka.cern/) - CERN, INFN

FLUKA is a general-purpose Monte Carlo simulation code for accurate modeling of particle transport and interaction with matter. It is freely available for non-commercial use and is applied across fields such as high-energy physics, medical physics, and space radiation analysis.
FLUKA is ideal for radiation shielding, dose estimation, energy deposition tracking, and particle shower simulation. It excels in 3D simulation using DICOM medical imaging and can model complex space radiation interactions.

# [Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/) - CERN

Geant4 is an open-source C++ simulation toolkit developed by CERN for modeling particle interactions with matter. It offers extensive flexibility in physics model configuration, enabling detailed simulations across a wide energy range.
Widely used in medical imaging, radiotherapy, space radiation studies, and detector design, Geant4 allows users to define custom scenarios and track secondary particle paths, energy deposition, and charge generation. It is especially effective for simulating SEE phenomena in detectors and semiconductor devices.

# [CHALICE](https://nanohub.org/resources/chalice) - US Naval Research Laboratory

CHALICE is a pulsed-laser simulator developed by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), designed to precisely calculate 2D/3D charge density distributions generated during SEE experiments.
By inputting laser parameters such as wavelength, pulse width, and absorption coefficient, users can simulate charge deposition in sensitive volumes (SV), carrier distributions, and energy penetration depth. It also enables calculation of laser-equivalent LET (<sub>L</sub>), offering a useful method to model SEE using optical injection.

# [OMERE](https://www.trad.fr/en/space/omere-software/) - TRAD

OMERE is a freeware platform developed by TRAD (France) for predicting radiation effects on semiconductor components under space conditions. It supports SEE, TID, DD, and solar cell degradation analysis based on particle fluxes.
The tool includes multiple space radiation environment models such as AE8/AP8, CREME96, ISO 15390, etc. Users can define LEO, MEO, GEO, and lunar orbits, solar cycles, magnetosphere structures, and shielding effects to generate realistic simulations. OMERE is also used for part screening and mission-specific radiation reliability assessments.
