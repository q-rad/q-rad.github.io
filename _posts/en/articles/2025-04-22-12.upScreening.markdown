In domains that demand high reliability-space, aerospace, and defense-the quality and reliability of each component critically affect overall system performance and mission safety. Equipping a system solely with fully qualified space-grade parts is often impractical due to cost, supply, and technical constraints.
As a result, the use of COTS (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf) parts can be unavoidable. In such cases, Up-Screening is applied to verify whether these parts can achieve the reliability needed for space environments.

# What is Up-Screening (Up-Screen)?
**Up-Screening** refers to additional testing and evaluation performed on parts that are not originally space-grade (e.g., COTS, automotive grade) to reduce risk and determine their suitability for use in high-reliability environments.  
It goes beyond basic functionality checks to assess temperature behavior, electrical performance, lifetime, and failure rates against space product assurance expectations. It's important to note that Up-Screening does not “promote” a part's manufacturer grade. It reduces risk through extra testing; it does not grant an official space-grade classification from the manufacturer.

# Up-Screening (Up-Screen) Items

## CA / DPA
Covers external marking/lead finish checks and detailed destructive physical analysis to examine internal structure, materials, and workmanship (e.g., die chipping/contamination, wire-bond quality, intermetallics).

</p>

## Mechanical Test
Verifies robustness against launch/space mechanical stresses such as vibration, mechanical shock, thermal/pressure-related loads.

</p>

## Reliability Test
Targets early-life failure removal and long-term stability (e.g., burn-in, life testing, temperature cycling).

</p>

## Radiation Test
Evaluates tolerance to the space radiation environment (electrons, protons, heavy ions, gamma), including TID, SEE, and displacement damage (DDD/TNID).

# Up-Screening (Up-Screen) Process

<div class="qrt-list">
  <h2>1. Mission/Risk Definition & Test Plan</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Define environmental, lifetime, availability, and radiation needs; document screening items, conditions, sample sizes (incl. PDA), and acceptance criteria.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Part Selection & Data Collection</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Gather datasheets, process/grade (e.g., AEC-Q), reliability reports, and supply-chain information.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Non-Destructive Screening</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Perform external/marking checks, pre/post electrical measurements, X-ray/CSAM to assure integrity before assembly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Environmental Stress Screening</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Apply temperature cycling, burn-in, and-if needed-thermal vacuum/vibration/shock to surface latent defects and check parameter stability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Radiation Evaluation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Depending on mission, apply TID (gamma), SEE (heavy ion/proton), and DDD (proton/neutron) per the project/agency RHA plan.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Lot Acceptance Test (LAT) & DPA</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Verify lot-to-lot consistency via representative LAT (electrical/environmental) and confirm internal workmanship/process via DPA.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Documentation, Traceability & Disposition</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Compile pre/post measurements, failure modes, rework status, compliance to acceptance criteria, and residual risk into SCDs and test reports.</li>
  </ul>
