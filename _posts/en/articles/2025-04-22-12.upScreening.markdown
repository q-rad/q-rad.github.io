# Up-Screening – Ensuring Reliability of COTS for Space Applications

In high-reliability sectors such as space, aerospace, and defense, the quality of each component directly impacts overall system performance and mission success.  
However, relying solely on space-grade components is often limited by cost, availability, and technical constraints.  
As a result, the use of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components has become increasingly common.  
To ensure these components are suitable for mission-critical applications, a process known as **Up-Screening** is applied.

## What is Up-Screening?

Up-screening is the process of performing additional qualification tests on non–space-grade components (e.g., COTS, automotive-grade) to assess their suitability for use in high-reliability environments.  
It goes beyond basic functional testing to evaluate characteristics such as temperature tolerance, electrical performance, aging behavior, and failure rates—aligned with space mission quality requirements.

The table below is an excerpt from NASA’s EEE-INST-002 document, which outlines component-level test matrices.  
Test requirements vary by mission criticality, classified into Levels 1 through 3.

### NASA Space Mission Levels

<details>
<summary class="clickable-summary">
<h4 style="display:inline-block">Level 1</h4>
</summary>

Represents the highest reliability and lowest acceptable risk.  
Active components must undergo **radiation hardness evaluation**, and if no existing data is available, dedicated **radiation testing** is required.  
Typical mission duration: **over 5 years**.
</details>

<details>
<summary class="clickable-summary">
<h4 style="display:inline-block">Level 2</h4>
</summary>

Applies to missions with moderate reliability requirements, balancing performance, cost, and risk.  
Radiation hardness should be reviewed, and testing is required in the absence of supporting data.  
Typical mission duration: **1 to 5 years**.
</details>

<details>
<summary class="clickable-summary">
<h4 style="display:inline-block">Level 3</h4>
</summary>

Includes components with higher or unknown risk due to lack of formal screening or qualification.  
These parts often lack reliable data or flight heritage, and process variations between lots can invalidate prior test data.  
Commonly used in CubeSats or low-cost experimental missions.  
Radiation review and testing are required if data is unavailable.  
Typical mission duration: **less than 1–2 years**.
</details>

The European Space Agency (ESA) defines Class 1 through Class 3 categories, offering guidance on supplementing up-screening when using AEC-Q qualified components.

  *AEC-Q: A qualification standard for automotive-grade electronic components.

ESA’s classification reflects different assurance and risk trade-offs:

- **Class 1**: Highest assurance, lowest risk. Highest procurement and test cost.
- **Class 2**: Balanced assurance level and cost.
- **Class 3**: Lowest assurance, highest risk. Lowest upfront cost.

Total cost of ownership (TCO) differences can be mitigated through additional engineering and validation.  
The choice of component class depends on mission objectives, constraints, and risk tolerance.
