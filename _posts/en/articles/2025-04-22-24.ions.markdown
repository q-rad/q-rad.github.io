# Ion

An ion is an atomic nucleus that has lost electrons and carries a positive charge. When ions strike a material, they ionize atoms by removing electrons through electric interactions, generating electron-hole pairs. Compared to other radiation types, ions deposit more energy in the material and produce more charge.

Even a small volume of silicon penetrated by a heavy ion can experience an intense burst of charge in a very short time. Ions travel through sensitive regions of silicon within tens of femtoseconds and come to a stop in less than a picosecond—much faster than the response time of typical semiconductor devices.

As an ion passes through, the generated charge forms a cylindrical distribution along its path, with lengths ranging from tens to hundreds of microns and radii on the nanometer scale. If this occurs in non-critical areas such as deep substrate layers or metal regions without active circuitry, it may not cause problems. However, if the ion traverses sensitive circuit regions, the deposited charge can disturb the operation and trigger malfunctions.

In low-voltage circuits, the generated electron-hole pairs can induce unwanted voltage or current levels, resulting in data errors in digital circuits or abnormal output in analog circuits. In CMOS devices, if the charge is deposited between closely spaced wells, it may form an unintended current path, leading to excessive current flow—a condition known as “latch-up.”

In high-voltage or power semiconductor devices, heavy ions can physically damage the junctions or gate oxides, potentially causing permanent failure.

Heavy ions are primarily found in space, particularly as part of galactic cosmic rays originating outside the solar system. These ions carry extremely high energy, enabling them to easily penetrate semiconductor packages and generate substantial charge. For this reason, heavy ions are a major cause of Single Event Effects (SEE) in space, and SEE testing for space-grade components is typically performed using heavy ions.

However, even in space, heavy ions are relatively rare and generally do not contribute significantly to Total Ionizing Dose (TID) or Displacement Damage (DD). On Earth, heavy ions are effectively blocked by the atmosphere and thus pose little risk to ground-based electronics.
