# Effects of Radiation on Semiconductors

The effects of radiation on semiconductors can be classified into the following three categories.

### 1. SEE (Single Event Effects)

SEE (Single Event Effects) occur when radiation (such as protons, neutrons, heavy ions, or gamma rays) ionizes the medium while passing through a semiconductor, causing operational errors in the circuitry. If the charge generated during ionization reaches the sensitive area of the semiconductor and is sufficient to change its operational state, an error can result. SEE is generally non-destructive and temporary, and normal operation can resume by resetting values or power.
SEE is typically evaluated using heavy ions.<br>
- SEE Types  
  - SEU (Single Event Upset): Data bit flip  
  - SET (Single Event Transient): Temporary voltage pulse  
  - SEL (Single Event Latch-up): Short-circuit through PNPN path in CMOS structure  
  - SEB (Single Event Burnout) / SEGR (Single Event Gate Rupture): Destruction of high-power devices  
  - SEFI (Single Event Functional Interrupt): System-level operational failure

### 2. TID (Total Ionizing Dose)

The charge generated by radiation accumulates in the semiconductor, gradually changing its characteristics. This is referred to as TID (Total Ionizing Dose). In CMOS devices, ionized charge can become trapped in the insulating layer or cause defects in the crystal structure.
TID evaluation is typically performed using gamma rays.<br>
- Key Impacts  
  - MOSFET threshold voltage (Vth) shift  
  - Threshold voltage inversion and increased drain leakage current  
  - Altered operational characteristics

### 3. DD (Displacement Damage)

Displacement Damage (DD) occurs within the semiconductor bulk, unlike TID which is limited to surfaces or interfaces. DD causes volumetric damage that affects the entire device, leading to changes in electrical, optical, and thermal properties and potentially degrading performance or functionality.
DD evaluation is typically done using neutrons.<br>
- Key Impacts  
  - Reduced carrier lifetime and mobility  
  - Increased reverse saturation current in PN diodes  
  - Overall degradation in performance

# Types of Radiation

Among the many types of radiation, those that typically affect semiconductors include:

- [Protons, Neutrons](/en/article/23.Nucleons.html)
- [Electrons](/en/article/22.electrons.html)
- [Heavy Ions](/en/article/24.ions.html)
- [Gamma Rays](/en/article/21.photons.html)
