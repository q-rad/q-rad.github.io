# Semiconductor Radiation Hardness Laser Evaluation (Laser Test)

The Pulsed Laser SEE Test (PLSEE) is a method for evaluating the radiation hardness of semiconductors using femtosecond pulsed lasers.  
It simulates the effects of space radiation on semiconductor devices, providing an effective alternative to traditional radiation testing methods.

Lasers can deliver extremely high energy to a highly localized area within an extremely short duration, inducing electromagnetic responses comparable to those caused by actual particle collisions.  
SEE evaluations are typically conducted at [heavy ion beam](/en/article/10.중이온.html) accelerator facilities.  
However, such facilities have several limitations, including high operational costs, restricted accessibility, and limited capability for precise vulnerability analysis.
<br>
The greatest advantage of laser testing is the reduction in experimental cost and turnaround time.  
Traditional radiation tests using particle accelerators are expensive and often difficult to schedule due to limited availability.  
In contrast, laser-based equipment is relatively inexpensive, can be installed and operated in laboratory environments, and supports rapid iterative testing.
<br>
Additionally, lasers offer extremely high spatial accuracy, enabling precise targeting of specific regions within semiconductor devices and facilitating in-depth analysis of vulnerable areas.  
This allows potential weaknesses to be identified and mitigated from the early stages of design.

## QRT's Laser Evaluation Technology

QRT is the only company in Korea with extensive experience in laser-based radiation hardness evaluation.  
Using a femtosecond pulsed laser system, QRT offers versatile evaluation capabilities supporting both Single Photon Absorption (SPA) and Two Photon Absorption (TPA) methods.  
We provide services for alternative radiation hardness testing of semiconductors and design validation of radiation-tolerant semiconductor devices.

## Sensitive Area Analysis

QRT's evaluation system features a high-precision XYZ stage controllable at the nanometer level, enabling precise laser targeting at specific coordinates on a semiconductor chip.  
This allows for detailed mapping of Single Event Effects (SEE), effectively identifying **Sensitive Areas** within the circuit layout.
