# Space Product Assurance – EEE (Electrical, Electronic, and Electromechanical) Components

EEE components refer to Electrical, Electronic, and Electromechanical parts, which are essential to the development and operation of space systems.  
These components play a critical role in the performance and reliability of satellites, spacecraft, and launch vehicles, and must operate reliably under harsh space conditions.  
Space Product Assurance encompasses a comprehensive set of activities and procedures aimed at ensuring the quality, reliability, and safety of EEE components for mission success.
<br>
The following are globally recognized standards used for the qualification and management of space-grade EEE components (also referred to as space semiconductors):

- <a href="https://ecss.nl/" target="_blank">**ECSS**</a> (European Cooperation for Space Standardization):  
  A formal set of international space standards developed by ESA (European Space Agency), European national space agencies, and industry partners to ensure quality, reliability, safety, and cost efficiency in space projects.

- <a href="https://www.dsp.dla.mil/Specs-Standards/" target="_blank">**MIL-STD**</a> (Military Standard):  
  A standardized system created by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) for military components, systems, equipment, and manufacturing processes.

- <a href="https://standards.nasa.gov/NASA-Technical-Standards" target="_blank">**NTSS (NASA Technical Standards System)**</a>:  
  NASA’s official integrated technical standards platform, widely used by NASA centers, contractors, research institutes, universities, and industry partners to maintain consistency and quality across NASA programs.

These standards cover every aspect of EEE component management—from testing and screening to procurement and certification—ensuring that components meet the rigorous demands of space applications.
