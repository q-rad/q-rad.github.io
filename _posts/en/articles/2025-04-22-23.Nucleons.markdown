# Neutron

Neutrons carry no electric charge and therefore do not interact via electric forces. As a result, they cannot directly cause ionization (i.e., the gain or loss of charge by atoms) when passing through a material. Instead, they lose energy through elastic or inelastic nuclear reactions—or, in rare cases, via magnetic interactions with unpaired electrons.

In simple terms, neutrons transfer energy only through direct collisions with other particles. Due to this limited interaction, they have very high penetration capabilities.

Neutrons commonly found on Earth can induce SEE (Single Event Effects), but typically do not possess enough energy to cause TID (Total Ionizing Dose) or DD (Displacement Damage).

# Proton

Protons, which have nearly the same mass as neutrons, carry a positive charge and behave differently in materials. Unlike neutrons, protons cause ionization as well as initiate nuclear reactions.

Protons are attracted to electrons and repelled by positively charged nuclei. Protons with kinetic energy below 50 MeV are generally deflected by electrostatic repulsion before reaching the nucleus. However, those with energies above 50 MeV can overcome this barrier and initiate nuclear reactions similar to neutrons.

In space, protons are a major source of radiation and are responsible for inducing SEE, TID, and DD.

### Elastic Reaction

An elastic reaction occurs when a neutron collides with a target nucleus, transferring part of its kinetic energy and bouncing off at reduced speed. The target nucleus recoils, and both energy and momentum are conserved.

If the neutron’s energy is high enough (typically above 100 keV), it can effectively displace the nucleus from its position. These displaced nuclei are known as recoil nuclei.

Neutron-induced displacement can alter local electrical properties in semiconductor devices. Repeated collisions with neutrons or protons lead to cumulative damage, contributing to [Displacement Damage](/en/article/18.DD.html).

Additionally, the recoil nuclei generated by neutron collisions behave like heavy ions as they move through the material, generating significant ionization. Each recoil nucleus has the potential to cause a Single Event Effect (SEE).

### Inelastic Nuclear Reaction

In an inelastic reaction, the neutron is absorbed by a nucleus, and its mass and energy are converted into an excited nuclear state. The way this excess energy is released depends on the type of nucleus and the kinetic energy of the neutron.

For neutrons in the several MeV to tens of MeV range, the absorbed energy is typically distributed among nucleons. The excited nucleus may then emit light particles (such as protons, neutrons, or light ions), gamma rays, and a heavier recoil nucleus.

These emitted particles, which often carry MeV-level energy, contribute to ionization and are a key source of SEE caused by neutrons.

In some cases, nuclear reactions may split the nucleus into two nearly equal-mass fragments along with the emission of additional neutrons—this is nuclear fission.

However, semiconductor devices contain heavy elements only in trace amounts (parts per billion), making fission a negligible contributor to SEE or TID. When thermal neutrons (below tens of keV) are absorbed, the excess energy is generally released as gamma rays.

### Spallation

When a neutron’s energy exceeds 100 MeV, its wavelength becomes short enough to interact with individual nucleons (protons or neutrons) inside the nucleus rather than the nucleus as a whole. This process is known as spallation.

In spallation, the neutron transfers energy to a single nucleon within the nucleus. The excited nucleus then ejects this nucleon, and the resulting particles can trigger additional nuclear reactions as they move through the material.

The image below summarizes four typical outcomes following an inelastic nuclear reaction initiated by a neutron:
