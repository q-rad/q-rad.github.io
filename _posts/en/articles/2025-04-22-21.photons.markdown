# Photon

A photon is the basic unit of electromagnetic energy, spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum—from low to high energy and long to short wavelengths. This includes radio waves, microwaves, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays.
<br>
Most electronic devices are enclosed in opaque packaging (e.g., plastic, ceramic, or metal), so photons in the visible light range generally pose little to no concern. However, high-energy photons such as X-rays and gamma rays can penetrate these materials and potentially affect device operation.
<br>
In both terrestrial and space environments, the direct impact of X-rays and gamma rays is typically considered less significant than other types of radiation.
<br>
In industrial and medical applications, however, X-rays and gamma rays are the primary radiation sources, with energies typically ranging from 10 keV to 1,000 keV. Within this range, the photoelectric effect is the dominant mechanism for generating charge, though Compton scattering also plays a role.
<br>
Because photons are electrically neutral, they do not interact in the same way as charged particles with electrons or atomic nuclei.
Below are the three main mechanisms by which photons transfer energy:

### 1. Photoelectric Effect

When a photon strikes a semiconductor and has sufficient energy to liberate an electron from the valence band or from a bound atomic state, the photon’s energy is transferred to the electron, producing a photoelectron and leaving behind a positively charged hole. This is known as the photoelectric effect.
<br>
Photons ranging from visible light to X-rays (up to around 100 keV) can excite tightly bound inner-shell electrons. When an inner-shell electron is ejected, the resulting vacancy is filled by an outer-shell electron, often emitting characteristic X-rays in the process. These emissions are element-specific.
<br>
The photoelectric effect is an inelastic interaction, where the photon’s energy is proportional to its frequency. If the photon energy is too low to generate an electron-hole pair, the photon passes through the material—this is referred to as transparency.

### 2. Compton Scattering

In Compton scattering, a photon collides with an electron and transfers part of its energy, producing a lower-energy scattered photon and a recoil electron. Depending on the energy transferred, the electron may be excited to a higher state or completely freed, allowing it to interact with other atoms or electrons.

### 3. Pair Production

Pair production is a key mechanism for gamma-ray energy loss and occurs when a high-energy photon interacts with an atomic nucleus to produce an electron-positron pair.
<br>
For this process to occur, the photon’s energy must exceed the combined rest mass energy of an electron and a positron. Any additional energy becomes kinetic energy shared by the two particles.
<br>
If the photon’s energy is below this threshold, pair production cannot take place. The likelihood of pair production increases with both photon energy and the atomic number of the material.
