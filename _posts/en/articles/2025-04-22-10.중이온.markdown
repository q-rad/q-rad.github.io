# What is a Heavy Ion Beam?

The diagram below illustrates various types of radiation particles and compares their relative masses.  
Assuming the mass of a proton or neutron is 1, the relative mass of an electron is approximately 1⁄1,840.  
While the electron is shown disproportionately large for visual clarity, the illustration effectively conveys the vast difference in mass between electrons and nucleons.

The nucleus of a helium atom is known as an alpha particle.  
Particles lighter than or equal to helium are typically referred to simply as **particles**, while nuclei of elements heavier than carbon are categorized as **heavy ions**.
<br>
Radiation in space is emitted either as electromagnetic waves or as particles.  
When radiation consists of particles heavier than electrons, it is called a **particle beam**.  
If these particles are heavier than helium nuclei, the beam is specifically referred to as a **heavy ion beam**.
<br>
As illustrated in the comparison table, general-purpose particle accelerators typically handle particles ranging from electrons to helium or carbon.  
In contrast, **heavy ion accelerators** are designed to accelerate ions from helium up to heavier elements such as xenon (Xe).
<br>
Because neutrons carry no electric charge, they cannot be directly accelerated by electromagnetic fields.  
Instead, neutrons are typically produced through nuclear reactions—such as by bombarding a target with accelerated protons or electrons to induce nuclear spallation.  
In addition, neutrons produced from nuclear reactions or nuclear reactors are also used.
