# What is a Heavy Ion Beam?

The diagram below shows several types of radiation particles and compares their relative masses.
Taking the mass of a proton or neutron as 1, the electron’s relative mass is approximately 1/1,836.
Although the electron is drawn disproportionately large for clarity, the illustration conveys the orders-of-magnitude difference between electrons and nucleons.

The nucleus of a helium atom is called an alpha particle.
In radiation-effects work, heavy ions generally refer to ions heavier than helium (atomic number Z ≥ 3), while electrons, protons, and helium nuclei are treated separately.

Radiation in space appears either as electromagnetic waves or as particles.
A particle beam is a collimated stream of accelerated particles (e.g., electrons, protons, ions, or neutrons).
When the beam consists of ions heavier than helium, it is specifically termed a heavy-ion beam.
<br>
As a rule of thumb, general-purpose accelerators commonly handle particles such as electrons, protons, and light ions (e.g., helium or carbon).
By contrast, heavy-ion accelerators are designed to accelerate ions from helium up to much heavier species such as xenon (Xe).
<br>
Because neutrons carry no electric charge, they cannot be directly accelerated by electromagnetic fields.
Instead, neutron beams are typically produced via nuclear reactions—for example, by bombarding a target with accelerated protons or electrons to induce spallation—or obtained from research reactors.
