Radiation particles, including ionizing radiation, are illustrated in this diagram, showing a comparison of their relative sizes.  
If the mass of a neutron and a proton is considered as 1, then the relative mass of an electron is 1⁄1,840.  
While the electron appears significantly larger in the diagram for visualization, it still gives a good idea of how light electrons are compared to protons and neutrons.

The nucleus of helium is known as an alpha particle. Particles up to helium are generally referred to simply as particles, while nuclei of elements with atomic numbers greater than carbon are referred to as **heavy ions**.  
Radiation can release energy during space travel in the form of waves or particles.  
Radiation composed of particles heavier than electrons is called a particle beam. When it is composed of particles heavier than helium, it is specifically referred to as a **heavy ion beam**.  

As shown in the comparison table, particle accelerators typically use particles from electrons to helium (or carbon), while heavy ion accelerators use particles ranging from helium to xenon (Xe).  
Since neutrons carry no charge, they cannot be directly accelerated. Therefore, neutrons are usually generated by colliding accelerated electrons or protons with a target to induce nuclear spallation.  
Other methods include using neutrons from nuclear reactions or nuclear reactors.
