# LEO (Low Earth Orbit)
LEO refers to an orbit formed below an altitude of approximately 2,000 km above Earth's surface, situated between the atmosphere and the Van Allen belts.  
This orbit is relatively less affected by solar protons and galactic cosmic rays (GCR), but significantly influenced by trapped radiation from the Van Allen belts.  
LEO is widely used for telecommunications, weather observation, and scientific missions, and the majority of currently operating satellites are located in this region.  
Due to its proximity to Earth, high-resolution imaging is possible, and mission durations typically range from 2 to 5 years.  
For example, the International Space Station (ISS) is in LEO, orbiting the Earth approximately 15.7 times per day at about 27,744 km/h.  
Since the radiation environment is relatively benign, it is possible to use Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components, making LEO well-suited for low-cost, large-scale satellite constellations.

### VLEO (Very Low Earth Orbit)
VLEO lies at an altitude of approximately 180–400 km.  
Its close proximity to Earth allows for ultra-high-resolution imaging and reduced communication latency.  
However, atmospheric drag causes high propellant consumption and short mission lifetimes.  
Trapped radiation is nearly absent in this region, with solar protons being the dominant radiation source.

# MEO (Medium Earth Orbit)
MEO spans altitudes from approximately 2,000 km to 35,786 km.  
Orbital periods range from 2 to 24 hours, with most satellites in this region orbiting every 10–12 hours.  
Compared to GEO, MEO offers lower latency and broader coverage than LEO with fewer satellites.  
However, it lies within the Van Allen radiation belts, leading to greater radiation exposure.  
Radiation-hardened design is essential in this environment.  
Navigation satellites such as GPS and Galileo operate in MEO.

# GEO (Geostationary Earth Orbit)
GEO lies at an altitude of approximately 35,786 km, where satellites revolve at the same angular speed as Earth’s rotation, appearing stationary from the ground.  
It is located above the equator and completes one orbit per day.  
This makes GEO ideal for continuous observation missions such as telecommunications, broadcasting, and weather satellites.  
Ground station antennas can be fixed in one direction for consistent coverage.  
However, high altitude results in significant signal latency and limits polar coverage. Launch costs are also higher.  
GEO is more exposed to high-energy particles due to reduced geomagnetic protection compared to LEO.  

There are two main methods by which satellites enter GEO:  
The first is chemical propulsion, where the satellite is launched into GTO (Geostationary Transfer Orbit), and then performs a single high-thrust burn at apogee to circularize into GEO.  
The second is electric propulsion, where the satellite enters GTO and then gradually raises its orbit using low-thrust engines over several months.  
During this period, the satellite completes hundreds of GTO orbits before reaching GEO altitude.  
Historically, chemical propulsion was dominant due to fast orbit insertion, but electric propulsion is now increasingly favored for its lower launch mass and cost efficiency.

### GTO (Geostationary Transfer Orbit)
Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO) is an intermediate elliptical orbit used to transfer satellites to GEO.  
Its perigee lies near LEO altitude, while its apogee reaches the GEO altitude of 35,786 km.  
The launch vehicle delivers the satellite to GTO’s perigee.  
Then, the satellite’s onboard propulsion performs a burn at apogee to circularize into GEO.  
This transfer typically uses a **Hohmann transfer**, known for fuel efficiency.  
In the diagram below, the yellow ellipse represents GTO, and the solid yellow line is the satellite trajectory.

# Radiation Assessment by Orbit

LEO benefits significantly from the shielding effect of the Van Allen belts.  
They reduce exposure to Solar Particle Events (SPE) and greatly attenuate galactic cosmic rays (GCR).  
The belts act like a cyclotron, accelerating and trapping particles, increasing their energy beyond that of solar wind particles—potentially enough to disrupt electronics.  

GEO, in contrast, is vulnerable to high radiation, especially during solar flares.  
Though GEO is outside the Van Allen belts, it still resides within the magnetosphere (~65,000 km), and transits through the belts during GTO transfers expose satellites to high radiation levels.  
Trapped particles have minimal influence at GEO altitude.
