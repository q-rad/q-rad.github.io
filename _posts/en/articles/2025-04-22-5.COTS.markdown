# What is COTS?

With the increasing involvement of the private sector in the space industry, Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products are gaining attention as viable alternatives for space system development.  
Unlike traditional space-grade components—which are expensive and time-consuming to develop—COTS components are mass-produced for commercial markets, offering advantages such as reduced costs, shorter development cycles, and faster integration of cutting-edge technologies.  
These characteristics make COTS especially attractive to startups and small research institutions.  
<br>
In terms of cost, COTS components benefit from economies of scale, significantly lowering overall system expenses.  
As for development time, leveraging pre-validated commercial products greatly reduces the duration required for design, manufacturing, and testing.  
Another notable advantage is the ability to rapidly incorporate high-performance technologies that evolve quickly in the commercial sector into space systems.  

However, despite these benefits, the use of COTS components presents key challenges in terms of reliability, quality assurance, and environmental robustness.  
<br>
COTS components are typically designed for terrestrial applications, and may degrade or fail when subjected to the extreme conditions of space—such as intense radiation, vacuum, and temperature fluctuations.  
Their lack of space-specific quality certification and limited long-term durability can pose serious risks to mission success.  
<br/>
To mitigate these risks, thorough testing and screening processes are essential. In addition, system-level strategies such as redundancy, fault-tolerant architecture, radiation shielding, and thermal control should be incorporated.  
Ensuring reliability requires a holistic approach that extends beyond the component level to include system-wide protections and validations.  
<br/>
In conclusion, while COTS components offer a promising path toward faster and more cost-effective space development, their application must be supported by rigorous verification procedures and robust design strategies.  
A balanced approach that carefully weighs their advantages against potential risks is critical for the success of space missions.
