Evaluating soft errors or single event phenomena occurring in high-altitude or outer atmospheric space should focus primarily on heavy ions and protons, which are particles observed in the space environment. Generally, space radiation testing is based on heavy ion and TID evaluations, with proton testing recommended as a secondary option.<br>

Another essential evaluation in space radiation testing is the Total Ionizing Dose (TID) effect caused by charged particles. Although this can be caused by protons and heavy ions, it is commonly and efficiently evaluated using gamma rays. <br>

Recently, the demand for electronic components exposed to radiation environments in advanced industries such as space, defense, nuclear, and medical sectors has increased rapidly. In the space sector in particular, electronic components mounted on satellites and launch vehicles are continuously exposed to space radiation, making it essential to verify that these components operate reliably in such environments. <br>

Radiation evaluation infrastructure is a key foundation for securing technology sovereignty in Korea’s independent development and potential export of space components. As private-led independent space development projects advance, the demand for highly reliable electronic components is increasing. <br>

Radiation test infrastructure not only strengthens the foundation of the space industry but is also a strategic asset for Korea to lead the future technological race in space. Below is a summary of Korea's major radiation evaluation facilities.

# Proton Accelerators

# Heavy Ion Accelerators

Currently, Korea does not have domestic heavy ion accelerator infrastructure suitable for SEE (Single Event Effect) testing of semiconductors. As a result, overseas facilities are required for space and radiation environment reliability tests.

To address this, the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) is pursuing heavy ion accelerator development. Additionally, the RAON accelerator by IBS (Institute for Basic Science) is Korea’s first large-scale heavy ion accelerator being developed for both nuclear physics and practical applications like SEE evaluation.

Once these projects are completed, independent SEE testing in Korea will be possible.
