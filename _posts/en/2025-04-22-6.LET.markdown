# LET (Linear Energy Transfer)

LET refers to the energy loss per unit path length of a particle as it traverses a material.  
The unit of LET is MeV·cm<sup>2</sup>/mg, and the energy loss per unit length of the path (MeV/cm) is normalized by the density of the target material (mg/cm<sup>3</sup>).  
This allows LET to be quoted independently of the specific target material.

Ionization loss is a very important process in semiconductor devices, and the characteristics of this ionization process can be represented by LET — the energy accumulated per unit path length as the particle penetrates the target material.  
Here, energy loss refers to the energy of the particle being dissipated as LET and accumulated in the target material.

In general, LET can also be expressed in terms of energy per distance, such as MeV·cm<sup>-1</sup>, eV·nm<sup>-1</sup>, or keV·nm<sup>-1</sup>.  
However, since the energy lost is proportional to the density of the material being penetrated, it is more useful to divide the linear energy transfer value by the density of the material.

According to various JEDEC standards, LET is typically expressed in units of MeV·cm<sup>2</sup>/mg.  
This value is calculated by dividing MeV·cm<sup>-1</sup> by the material density in mg/cm<sup>3</sup>.  
Thus, LET normalized by the density of the target material is represented in units of MeV·cm<sup>2</sup>/mg.
