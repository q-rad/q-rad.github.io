During laser radiation evaluation, the absorption mechanism varies depending on the substrate material used in the semiconductor device and the wavelength of the laser.  
The following table summarizes the differences in possible photon absorption mechanisms by semiconductor material under the wavelengths used by QRT.

Among semiconductor materials, **silicon (Si)** has a relatively small band gap, allowing evaluation using single photon absorption (SPA) mechanisms with relatively long wavelengths such as 1064nm.  
In contrast, **GaAs (Gallium Arsenide)**, **SiC (Silicon Carbide)**, and **GaN (Gallium Nitride)**, which are commonly used in power semiconductor devices, have wide band gaps and thus cannot be evaluated via SPA at the same wavelength.  

For instance, a laser with a wavelength of 630nm has photon energy of about 2eV, so in materials with a larger band gap, **two-photon absorption (TPA)** mechanisms—where two photons are simultaneously absorbed—are required to excite an electron above the band gap.

To perform laser evaluations on such a variety of materials, QRT possesses laser irradiation equipment capable of covering a **broad wavelength range from 630nm to 1700nm**, and implementing ultrashort pulse widths of at least **200 fs**.  
This enables flexible radiation hardness evaluations tailored to different semiconductor devices.
