In fields requiring high reliability such as space, aviation, and defense industries, the quality and reliability of each component significantly impact the performance and stability of the entire system.  
However, configuring all components using only space-grade parts often faces limitations in terms of cost, supply, and technical constraints.  
As a result, the use of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components becomes inevitable in many cases.  
In such cases, **Up-Screening** is applied as a method to ensure reliability suitable for space environments.

# What is Up-Screening?
Up-screening refers to the procedure of conducting additional tests and evaluations on commercial-grade components (such as COTS or Automotive Grade) that are not originally classified as space-grade, to ensure their usability in high-reliability environments.  
This goes beyond basic functional testing to rigorously verify various reliability elements—such as temperature characteristics, electrical performance, lifespan, and failure rates—according to space mission quality standards.

The table below is part of the EEE component test matrix summarized from a NASA document.  
Test requirements vary depending on the space mission level (Level 1–3).

NASA’s space mission levels are as follows:

<details>
<summary class="clickable-summary">
<h4 style="display:inline-block">
Level 1
</h4>
</summary>

This level requires the highest reliability and minimum risk.  
Active components must undergo **Radiation Hardness** evaluation, and if no data is available, **Radiation Testing** is mandatory.  
Typical mission duration is over 5 years.

</details>

<details>
<summary class="clickable-summary">
<h4 style="display:inline-block">
Level 2
</h4>
</summary>

This level targets missions with low to moderate risk, balancing cost constraints and mission goals.  
Radiation hardness should still be evaluated, and radiation testing is required if relevant data is lacking.  
Typical mission duration is 1 to 5 years.

</details>

<details>
<summary class="clickable-summary">
<h4 style="display:inline-block">
Level 3
</h4>
</summary>

Level 3 components inherently have high or unknown risk due to lack of formal reliability screening and qualification.  
They often lack reliable data or flight heritage, and changes in design, materials, and processes mean test data from one lot may not apply to another.  
These components are used in high-risk missions (e.g., CubeSats, low-cost satellites).  
Radiation review is required, and radiation testing is necessary if no data is available.  
Typical mission duration is less than 1 to 2 years.

ESA defines classes 1 through 3 and provides guidelines on how to supplement Up-Screening when using AEC-Q components.

  *AEC-Q is a standard for testing and qualifying electronic components used in the automotive industry.

ESA space mission classification offers varying trade-offs between assurance levels and risk.  
Class 1 provides the highest assurance and lowest risk, while Class 3 allows the lowest assurance and highest risk.  
Procurement cost is typically highest for Class 1 and lowest for Class 3.  
However, the difference in Total Cost of Ownership can be reduced through mitigation and engineering measures.  
The appropriate component class depends on project objectives, definitions, and constraints.
